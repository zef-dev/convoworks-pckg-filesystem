    <h3>Media Context</h3>
    
    <p>Reads mp3 files from the filesystem and exposes it as a media source for media related components</p>

    <h4>Minimal setup</h4>
    <p>
        Just enter the base path, where are files located physically, and base url to form publicly accessible url for mp3 files.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Search functionality</h4>
    <p>
        If you provide search criteria, the songâ€™s title and artist will be matched against it.
        If you provide folder search criteria only, only complete folders will be taken in count.
    </p>
        
    <h4>Media info</h4>
    <p>
        Media Context provides media info data which you can use through connected components (e.g. Media info element, Media block). 
        In these components, you will provide a name under which this data (associative array) will be available and here are the fields it consists of.
